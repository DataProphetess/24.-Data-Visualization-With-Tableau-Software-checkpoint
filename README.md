📊 Chocolate Sales Dashboard (Built with Tableau)

As part of my data visualization practice, I used a chocolate sales dataset to build an interactive and insightful dashboard in Tableau. The final dashboard combines multiple visualizations to explore sales performance, customer segments, and profitability trends.

🔍 Key Dashboard Components:

📊 Column Chart: Displays Segment vs Category and Ship Status with the sum of sales, providing a breakdown of sales distribution across customer types and shipping stages.

📈 Bar Chart: Shows the running total of profit by month (based on Order Date), helping track profitability trends over time.

🥧 Pie Chart: Visualizes the Segment vs Sum of Profit, offering a quick view of which customer segments contribute most to overall profit.

All visuals were integrated into a single dashboard for a cohesive analytical view.

I also worked on data visualization using tableau. You can view some of the dashboard via the link below.
